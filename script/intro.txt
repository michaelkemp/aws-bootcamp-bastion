Hi Everyone.

Before we begin the AWS Bastion section of this training, I'd like to walk through setting up a development environment. 
This takes about 8 and a half minutes, so if you have an environment and want to skip forward, feel free. 
If you would like step by step instructions, they can be found at the displayed GitHub link, which also contains the terraform code I will use in this training.
I am also not using my own voice because, as James will attest, I do not like how it sounds. So, I am using AWS Poly, to narrate the presentation.
