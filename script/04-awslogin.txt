Next, I install BYU's AWS command line login. 
This enables us to log on to BYU accounts from the command line rather than the console. 
Once logged on, we can use the AWS command line tool we just installed to manipulate infrastructure.
As you can see, like the console login found at AWS login dot BYU dot E-D-U, the command line login also requires multi-factor authentication.
